Write a detailed SOP describing about what you are planning to work on during the Delta Summer Mentorship 2020. Mention all about your experiences and projects that you have completed. As mentioned before, we will be looking at your prior experiences and will filter applicants for this profile.

 
The Delta Summer Mentorship is an amazing opportunity for students in general and has a greater appeal to me as I focus most of my initial work and studies on programming and electrical engineering.

I have a set of goals and want to learn, explore and be able to make a career out of the things that I am fond of. Reflecting on my ardent interest to keep myself updated in the field of my interest, I would like to work more on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. To support my ambitions, I hope to work dedicatedly with the college faculty and with off campus research centers on projects and internships.

My coding experience started when I began a Machine Learning with MATLAB set of online degrees and coursework on MathWorks. My sister works as a Teaching Assistant for a graduate level course on ‘Artificial Intelligence in Energy Systems. Under her mentorship, I am currently working on a 3 month project using Schneider Electric’s Building Energy Management datasets. The project uses the energy consumption of different buildings to make a model that forecasts the power usage. The model uses predictors such as weather, holidays, season and more. The dataset has hourly observations of each building and each timestamp consists of dew point, humidity, temperature and more.  

I initially started with the MATLAB Onramp course to learn the programming language. Then I went forward with the Machine Learning Onramp course where I learnt the very basics and theoretical concepts of Machine Learning. After completing that, I went on to complete the Core Machine Learning Data Science. Although it took a long time to complete, I learnt all the knowledge to do a Machine Learning project all by myself. I am currently doing a Machine Learning project to forecast the power requirements based on energy consumptions of buildings.

I plan on extending my coding knowledge, but not too far from Machine Learning during this Summer Mentorship program. Learning multiple languages and gathering knowledge on the various platforms to apply it will be my main goal.

Knowing the importance of learning multiple programming languages and that of operating systems platforms, I’d like to learn these during the Summer Mentorship. I want to do more projects and apply the knowledge gained to make sure I have learned the various languages thoroughly.

In order to pursue my intended research projects and internships, I believe it is necessary that I study, understand and apply the finer nuances of my passion. I believe that I can set a strong beginning to my career under the guidance of such an esteemed club.

Given the opportunity, I feel that I will be able to contribute tremendously toward the club while pursuing my own projects under a very motivating and supportive learning environment.
